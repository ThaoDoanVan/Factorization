# Factorization
This report shall give a brief description of the three simple methods for
factorization: trial division, Pollard’s rho and Pollard’s p − 1 algorithms. We
provide experimental results of each method, and test the performance of
the general factorization tool which applies all the three methods above.

This is a group project of the subject "Développement logiciels cryptographiques" in the Master CRYPTIS course, at the University of Limoges, France.
